This is 15 days of me learning the python basic again instead of doing an actual project. Basically back to basic.

There're four collection data types in python:
- List: A collection which is ordered and changeable (modifiable). Allows duplicate members.
- Tuple: A collection which is ordered and unchangeable or unmodifiable. Allows duplicate members.
- Set: A collection which is unordered, unindexed, unmodifiable but you can add new items. No duplicate members.
- Dictionary: A collection which is unordered, changeable (modifiable), and indexed. No duplicate members.
