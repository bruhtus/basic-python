This is 15 days of me learning the python basic again instead of doing an actual project. Basically back to basic.

There're four collection data types in python:
- List: A collection which is ordered and changeable (modifiable). Allows duplicate members.
- Tuple: A collection which is ordered and unchangeable or unmodifiable. Allows duplicate members.
- Set: A collection which is unordered, unindexed, unmodifiable but you can add new items. No duplicate members.
- Dictionary: A collection which is unordered, changeable (modifiable), and indexed. No duplicate members.

If the processing logic require so, the sequential flow of execution can be altered in two way:
- Conditional execution: a block of one or more stetements will be executed if a certain expression is true.
- Repertitive execution: a block of one or more statements will be repetitively executed as long as a certain expression is true.

Function is a reuseable block of code or programming statements  designed to perform a certain task.

To define a function, python provides the `def` keyword. The function block of code is executed only if we call it.

Function can also return values, if a function does not return any, the value of the function is none.

If we don't know the number of arguments we pass to our function, we can create a function which can take arbitrary number of arguments by adding `*` before the parameters name.

A module is a file containing a single variable, or a function, or a big code base.
